    "For example, in the simplest case this microscopic process is a normalized random walk with a constant drift.\n",
    "2. Generate paths with this microscopic process `from the current time to the maturity of the priced asset`.\n",
    "2. For each of the $\\,N\\,$ paths, calculate the value of the investigated asset at the path's end point.\n",

    "# Self-financing portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plain English explanations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The term `self-financing describes` the `time evolution` of a portfolio, `not the current state`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In other words, this portfolio is similar to a locked box. You can move capital inside this box, but not into our out from this box.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In other words,\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "(3a) if any of the assets within this portfolio has gains, then that gain is invested in the assets of the portfolio, \n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "and (3b) if any of the assets has losses, then that loss can be compensated for only from one of the portfolio's other assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. \"A portfolio is self-financing\" means that the portfolio has no incoming or outgoing capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In other words, if your portfolio is made up of assets A and B, and you have a loss on A, \n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "then you can revert A to its initial value $-$ that is, buy more A $-$ only by selling B.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start a portfolio made up of 100 USD in a cash account and 1 share of Apple stock. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the stock's value goes up, you can sell stock and put the cash on your cash account.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the stock's value goes down, you can compensate for the loss of value by buying more stock with the cash on your cash account.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Example no.3. shows that your cash account `can be used for hedging`,\n",
