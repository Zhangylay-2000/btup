    "# Basic terms\n",
    "\n",
    "## Default and survival probability\n",
    "\n",
    "`Default` is the noun describing one's failure to pay timely. In this case the contractual party `defaults` (verb).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a selected company, let us denote its `probability of default` between now (time $0$) and time $\\,t>0\\,$ by $\\,{\\mathrm{PD}}\\left(\\,0,\\,t\\,\\right)\\,$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inversely, the `survival probability` of the same company over the same time window is $\\,S\\left(\\,0,\\,t\\,\\right)=1-{\\mathrm{PD}}\\left(\\,0,\\,t\\,\\right)\\,$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the first argument of the survival probability is zero, then it is practical to omit it. So we write $\\,S\\left(\\,t\\,\\right)\\,$.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2008 Iceland's three major privately owned commercial banks defaulted. Depositors of these banks outside Iceland were also affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unconditional default probability\n",
    "\n",
    "From time $\\,t\\,$ to time $\\,t+\\Delta t\\,$ the survival probability drops from $\\,S\\left(\\,t\\,\\right)\\,$ to \n",
    "$\\,S\\left(\\,t+\\Delta t\\,\\right)\\,$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, in this time window the `unconditional default probability` is $\\,S\\left(\\,t\\,\\right) - S\\left(\\,t+\\Delta t\\,\\right)\\,$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hazard function\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let us now start by assuming that a company has survived (not defaulted) until time $\\,t\\,$.\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "The probability of this event is $\\,S\\left(\\,t\\,\\right)\\,$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Therefore, `default probability conditional on` no earlier default is \n",
    "$\\,\\displaystyle{\\frac{S\\left(\\,t\\,\\right) - S\\left(\\,t+\\Delta t\\,\\right)}{S\\left(\\,t\\,\\right)}}\\,$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In this $\\,\\Delta t\\,$ long time window the `conditional rate of default` (also called: relative rate of default) is \n",
    "$\\,\\displaystyle{\\frac{S\\left(\\,t\\,\\right) - S\\left(\\,t+\\Delta t\\,\\right)}{S\\left(\\,t\\,\\right)\\,\\cdot\\,\\Delta t}}\\,$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The `hazard function` (also called: failure rate, or the `hazard rate`, or the `default intensity function`)<br/>\n",
    "is the $\\,\\Delta t\\to 0\\,$ limiting case of the conditional rate of default:<br/>\n",
    "$\\,\\displaystyle{\n",
    "\\color{red}{h\\left(\\,t\\,\\right)=}\\\n",
    "\\frac{S\\left(\\,t\\,\\right) - S\\left(\\,t+\\Delta t\\,\\right)}{S\\left(\\,t\\,\\right)\\,\\cdot\\,\\Delta t}\\Bigg|_{\\Delta t\\to 0}\\!\\!=\\\n",
    "\\!-\\,\\frac{1}{S\\left(\\,t\\,\\right)}\\cdot\\frac{ S\\left(\\,t+\\Delta t\\,\\right)-S\\left(\\,t\\,\\right)}{\\Delta t}\\Bigg|_{\\Delta t\\to 0}\\!\\!=\\\n",
    "\\!-\\,\\frac{1}{S\\left(\\,t\\,\\right)}\\cdot\\frac{d}{dt}S\\left(\\,t\\,\\right)=\\\n",
    "\\color{red}{-\\frac{d}{dt}\\,\\log S\\left(\\,t\\,\\right)}\n",
    "}\\,$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In summary, the hazard function is the rate of default at time $\\,t\\,$ with the condition that the company has survived until that time."
