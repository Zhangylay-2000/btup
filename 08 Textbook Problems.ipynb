Assume that (a) the yearly constant continuously compounded risk-free rate is $\\,r\\,$ and (b) the length of each month is $\\,\\frac{1}{12}\\,$. What $\\,\\frac{x}{N}\\,$ ratio makes the sum of the PVs (present values) of your $\\,m\\,$ payments equal to the received $\\,N\\,$ amount ? Select a range of $\\,r\\,$ values and a fixed $\\,m\\,$ value, and plot the result.\n",
